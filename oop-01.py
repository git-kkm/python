# class has attributes and methods

# Instances of a class have attributes, which are pieces of data associated with them.

# The __init__ method is called the class constructor.

# Classes can also have class attributes, created by assigning variables within the body of the class. These can be accessed either from instances of the class, or the class itself.

# Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class.

# Trying to access an attribute of an instance that isn't defined causes an AttributeError. This also applies when you call an undefined method.
