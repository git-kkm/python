# Sets are data structures, similar to lists or dictionaries.
# They are created using curly braces, or the set function.
# They share some functionality with lists, such as the use of "in" to check whether they contain a particular item.

# To create an empty set, you must use set(), as {} creates an empty dictionary.

# They are unordered, which means that they can't be indexed.
#KK They cannot contain duplicate elements.
# Due to the way they're stored, it's faster to check whether an item is part of a set, rather than part of a list.
# Instead of using append to add to a set, use add.
# The method remove removes a specific element from a set; pop removes an arbitrary element.

# Basic uses of sets include membership testing and the elimination of duplicate entries.
