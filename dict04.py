# I want to merge two dictionaries.
# The update() method would be what I need, if it returned its result instead of 
# modifying a dict in-place.

# x = {'a':1, 'b': 2}
# y = {'b':10, 'c': 11}
# z = x + y


# To be extra-clear, the last-one-wins conflict-handling of dict.update() 
# is what I'm looking for as well.)
