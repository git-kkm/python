# Class methods are different - they are called by a class, which is passed to the cls parameter of the method.

# A common use of these are factory methods, which instantiate an instance of a class, using different parameters than those usually passed to the class constructor.

# Class methods are marked with a classmethod decorator.


class Rectangle:
  def __init__(self, width, height):
    self.width = width
    self.height = height

  def calculate_area(self):
    return self.width * self.height

  @classmethod
  def new_square(cls, side_length):
    return cls(side_length, side_length)

square = Rectangle.new_square(5)
print(square.calculate_area())

# new_square is a class method and is called on the class, rather than on an instance of the class. It returns a new object of the class cls.

# Technically, the parameters self and cls are just conventions; they could be changed to anything else. However, they are universally followed, so it is wise to stick to using them.
