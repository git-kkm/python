# Magic Methods

# Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names.
# They are also known as dunders.
# So far, the only one we have encountered is __init__, but there are several others.
# They are used to create functionality that can't be represented as a normal method.

# One common use of them is operator overloading.
# This means defining operators for custom classes that allow operators such as + and * to be used on them.
# An example magic method is __add__ for +.

class Vector2D:
  def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
  def __add__(self, other):
    return Vector2D(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

first = Vector2D(5, 7)
second = Vector2D(3, 9)
result = first + second
print(result.x)
print(result.y)


# More magic methods for common operators:
# __sub__ for -
# __mul__ for *
# __truediv__ for /
# __floordiv__ for //
# __mod__ for %
# __pow__ for **
# __and__ for &
# __xor__ for ^
# __or__ for |

# Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.
# __lt__ for <
# __le__ for <=
# __eq__ for ==
# __ne__ for !=
# __gt__ for >
# __ge__ for >=

# There are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.
# __len__ for len()
# __getitem__ for indexing
# __setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
# __delitem__ for deleting indexed values
# __iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
# __contains__ for in

# The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y).
# However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called.
# There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.


# In Python 3.0, 5 / 2 will return 2.5 and 5 // 2 will return 2. The former is floating point division, and the latter is floor division, sometimes also called integer division.
