# Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).
# Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

# Tuples can be created without the parentheses, by just separating the values with commas.

my_tuple = "one", "two", "three"
print(my_tuple[0])

print(my_tuple[0:2])
