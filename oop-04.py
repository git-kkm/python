# __new__ is the first step of instance creation. It's called first, and is responsible for returning a new instance of your class.
# In contrast, __init__ doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance after it's been created.

# an object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary).

# The object's reference count decreases when it's deleted with del, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope.

# When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python automatically deletes it.
